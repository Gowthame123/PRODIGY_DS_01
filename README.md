# Population Data Analysis 📊

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **population data** to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to population growth, demographics, and distributions. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualizations, and statistical examinations.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains population-related attributes such as:
- **Yearly population estimates**
- **Country-wise distribution**
- **Urban vs. rural population**
- **Age group distributions**
- **Growth rate trends**

## 🔍 Steps Performed
### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Checked for **missing values** and handled them appropriately.
- Standardized column names for consistency.
- Converted categorical variables into numerical representations where needed.

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Visualizations:**
  - Population growth trends over time.
  - Country-wise population distribution.
  - Age group demographics.
  - Urban vs. rural population trends.
  - Correlation heatmap of key factors.

- **Statistical Tests:**
  - **Correlation Analysis** to find relationships between different population factors.
  - **Growth Rate Analysis** to identify high-growth regions.

## 📊 Key Insights
✔ **Certain regions experience higher growth rates** compared to others.
✔ **Urbanization trends show a shift towards city-based living.**
✔ **Aging populations in some countries affect workforce availability.**
✔ **Developing nations see faster population expansion.**

## 🚀 How to Run the Code
### Prerequisites:
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### Run the Script:
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/population-data-analysis.git
cd population-data-analysis
```
2. Run the Python script:
```bash
python population_analysis.py
```

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization)
- **Scipy** (Statistical analysis)

## 📢 Future Work
- Incorporating **GDP & economic factors** into population analysis.
